              demands during the upcoming February 17 to 18 trilateral
              US-Ukrainian-Russian talks in Geneva, Switzerland. </strong
            >Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on February 16 that
            Russian Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky will head the Russian
            delegation at the upcoming trilateral meetings.[1] Peskov noted that
            the Russian delegation will also include Russian Deputy Foreign
            Minister Mikhail Galuzin and Russian General Staff’s Main
            Intelligence Directorate (GRU) First Deputy Head Lieutenant General
            Vladimir Kostyukov.[2] Peskov stated that Russian Direct Investment
            Fund (RDIF) CEO Kirill Dmitriev will be in Geneva but will be
            attending a working group on economic cooperation, likely referring
            to the US-Russian bilateral economic group.[3]
          </p>

          <p>
            Peskov stated that the Geneva talks would discuss a “broader” range
            of issues than previous talks in Abu Dhabi and would particularly
            discuss territorial issues.[4] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
            Sergei Ryabkov stated that the Kremlin has instructed the Russian
            delegation to act within the framework that Russian President
            Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump allegedly agreed to
            during the August 2025 Alaska Summit.[5] Kremlin officials have
            previously claimed that the Alaska Summit agreed to principles based
            on Putin’s June 2024 speech to the Russian Ministry of Foreign
            Affairs (MFA), in which Putin insisted on capitulation to Russia’s
            demands of both Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
            (NATO).[6] The Kremlin has repeatedly demonstrated its full
            commitment to achieving its original war aims, including those not
            related to territory in eastern Ukraine.[7]

              >Russia may try to exploit another temporary moratorium on strikes
              against energy infrastructure to falsely claim that Russia is
              making a concession.</strong
            >
            Ukrainian Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov stated on February
            14 that Ukraine will raise the issue of another temporary energy
            strikes ceasefire in the Geneva meetings.[8] Russia has previously
            used temporary moratoriums on energy strikes in March-April 2025 and
            in January-February 2026 to stockpile drones and missiles for
            subsequent devastating strikes.[9] The Kremlin agreed to the
            January-February 2026 moratorium on strikes against some Ukrainian
            energy infrastructure only after inflicting severe damage to
            Ukraine’s national energy grid. The Kremlin will likely again try to
            portray its adherence to any future short-term moratorium as a
            significant concession, even though the Kremlin will likely use
            those days to stockpile weapons for larger strike packages. Russian
            forces have also already degraded Ukraine’s energy grid such that
            Ukraine faces major power issues even when Russia temporarily stops
            its strikes. Ukraine’s energy grid suffered significant shutdowns
            during the January-February 2025 strikes moratorium due to the
            months and years worth of damage the grid had already sustained.[10]
            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported on February 14 that
            Russian strikes have damaged every power plant in Ukraine, and
            Ukraine may again face major power issues during a future
            moratorium.[11]

              >Russia appears to be investing in centralized incubators for
              drone technology and is setting up bespoke roles and units to
              support specific drone capability development efforts. These drone
              capability development efforts include supporting drone units’
              ability to conduct tactical tasks that support Russia’s
              battlefield air interdiction (BAI) campaign, as well as
              drone-based air defense. </strong
            >Former Russian space agency Roscosmos head and Zaporizhia Oblast
            occupation senator Dmitry Rogozin stated on February 16 that the
            BARS-Sarmat Unmanned Systems Special Purpose Center (formerly
            BARS-Sarmat Detachment), which Rogozin oversees, is expanding its
            roster of specialized roles, expanding combat units, and conducting
            additional recruitment.[12] The BARS-Sarmat Center is a key research
            and development (R&amp;D) organization for Russian drone
            capabilities and develops and tests hardware and operational
            concepts before proliferating new technologies and drone tactics
            more broadly across Russian drone units.[13] The official Telegram
            channel of the BARS-Sarmat Unmanned Systems Special Purpose Center
            stated that the center is not just a group of drone operators but a
            comprehensive structure that integrates reconnaissance, strike
            capabilities, electronic warfare (EW), engineering development,
            production, and training under one organization.[14] The BARS-Sarmat
            Center stated that it also includes two specialized detachments —
            the ”Dnepr” and ”Stalingrad” detachments — which specialize in
            operating drones at operational depths of up to 30 to 35 kilometers
            and a separate “Bagration” air defense detachment, which specializes
            in intercepting Ukrainian drones using unmanned systems. The
            BARS-Sarmat Center stated that it is developing a “new” military
            specialty role called the “soldier technologist” — a role likely
            designed to facilitate the development and integration of drone
            capabilities across Russian combat forces writ large. The
            BARS-Sarmat Center also includes a specialized detachment — the
            Ustinov Scientific and Technical Detachment — which manufactures and
            modernizes equipment considering combat experience from the front.
            Each of these new units notably focuses on different elements of
            Russia’s BAI campaign, including enabling mid-range strikes,
            interceptor drones, and technological adaptations. Russia’s BAI
            campaigns have been largely responsible for facilitating Russian
            advances on the battlefield in Fall and Winter 2025. Russia’s
            investment in specialized units meant to develop, refine, and
            proliferate Russian drone capabilities is noteworthy. ISW previously
            observed reports that Russian plans to reorganize the BARS-Sarmat
            Center and at least five separate Russian Unmanned Systems Forces
            (USF) regiments into six USF brigades, and the further development
            and expansion of the center may allow Russia to more quickly
            disseminate successful drone developments across the Russian
            military.[15]

              >The Kremlin appears to be adapting its tactics to conduct
              sabotage attacks in Europe. </strong
            >Western intelligence officials stated to the
            <em>Financial Times </em>(<em>FT</em>) on February 15 that former
            Wagner Group recruiters, who previously recruited Russians to fight
            in Ukraine, are now organizing Kremlin-sponsored sabotage attacks in
            Europe.[16] Sources told<em> FT</em> that the Russian General Staff
            Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) is leveraging Wagner’s
            recruitment network in Europe while attempting to maintain at least
            two degrees of separation from the agents to maintain plausible
            deniability. The Wagner Group recruiters are reportedly trying to
            attract Europeans, particularly those who are “economically
            vulnerable” or lack purpose or direction in their lives, to conduct
            arson attacks or to pose as putative Nazi propagandists in Europe.
            <em>FT</em>‘s February 15 report follows earlier reports that
            Russia’s sabotage campaign deintensified in 2025, likely as the
            Kremlin reassessed its tactics.[17] US and European officials told
            Bloomberg in August 2025 that the decline may have been due to
            Kremlin efforts to regain control over the unreliable local
            criminals it often used for these attacks.[18] The officials noted
            at the time that many potential recruits were likely less willing to
            participate in Russia’s attacks, given that several agents were
            arrested and prosecuted. The GRU also reportedly was redirecting
            resources away from the European sabotage campaign and towards the
            war in Ukraine. The Kremlin began a campaign to reassert control
            over the Wagner Group and other irregular forces and integrate them
            into Russian state services starting in late 2022 and intensified
            this campaign following the Wagner Group’s mutiny in June 2023.[19]
            The GRU appears to be leveraging former Wagner Group elements to
            fulfill the GRU’s needs in Europe, potentially allowing the GRU to
            focus more of its organic resources on Ukraine. Russia may
            reintensify its sabotage campaign in 2026 by shifting from using
            unreliable organized crime networks to financially motivated
            individual agents.

              damage to Russia’s Kapustin Yar launch site in Astrakhan Oblast in
              January 2025. </strong
            >A Ukrainian open-source intelligence (OSINT) outlet published on
            February 16 satellite imagery collected on an unspecified date
            showing a six-meter crater near the fence of a preparation area at
            Kapustin Yar.[20] The Ukrainian General Staff reported that
            Ukrainian forces conducted a strike series that included Flamingo
            missiles against Kapustin Yar in January 2025 and later stated that
            the strikes damaged a technical facility that serviced missiles, an
            assembly building, and a logistics warehouse.[21] This recent
            satellite imagery suggests that at least one of the Flamingo
            missiles reached Kapustin Yar but that it either missed its intended
            target or that Russian forces intercepted the missile. The available
            satellite imagery is limited in scope, and other Ukrainian missiles
            may have struck other areas of Kapustin Yar. A Russian milblogger
            claimed on February 16 that Ukrainian forces launched four total
            Flamingo missiles in the strike package.[22]

            Ukrainian Center for Countering Disinformation Head Lieutenant
            Andriy Kovalenko, who often reports on successful Ukrainian drone
            strikes, posted images on February 15 of fires near the Belgorod
            Combined Heat and Power Plant in Belgorod Oblast, implying that
            Ukrainian forces struck the plant.[23] Belgorod Oblast Governor
            Vyacheslav Gladkov acknowledged that the Ukrainian forces’ strike on
            Belgorod Oblast significantly damaged energy facilities.[24]
            Kovalenko also posted footage of smoke plumes on February 15 in
            Bryansk Oblast, implying that Ukrainian forces struck unspecified
            targets in Bryansk Oblast.[25] Footage published on February 15
            shows a burning electrical substation near Vygonichi, Bryansk
            Oblast.[26] Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz acknowledged
            that the strike caused power and heating outages in five
            municipalities and part of Bryansk City.[27]

            Assessed Russian infiltrations: Geolocated footage published on
            February 16 shows Russian servicemembers operating in eastern and
            central Pokrovka (southeast of Sumy City) during what ISW assesses
            was a Russian infiltration mission that did not change control of
            terrain or the forward edge of the battle area (FEBA) at this
            time.[28]

            Unconfirmed claims: The Russian Ministry of Defense (MoD) claimed
            that elements of the Russian 34th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade
            (49th Combined Arms Army [CAA], Southern Military District [SMD])
            seized Pokrovka.[29] A Russian milblogger claimed that Russian

            of Pokrovka.[30]

            An officer of a Ukrainian brigade operating in northern Kharkiv
            Oblast reported on February 16 that Russian forces are accumulating
            personnel for further assaults, but that Ukrainian forces have fire
            control over Russian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) and are
            preventing Russian forces from concentrating or using armored
            vehicles.[37] The officer reported that Russian forces are primarily
            assaulting in small groups and use light transport vehicles. The
            officer noted that poor weather conditions are complicating drone
            reconnaissance and logistics for both sides.

            Russian forces attacked near Kupyansk itself, south of Kupyansk near
            Kupyansk-Vuzlovyi, and southeast of Kupyansk near Kurylivka and
            Pishchane on February 15 and 16.[44]

            Ukrainian Joint Forces Task Force Spokesperson Colonel Viktor
            Trehubov reported on February 16 that Ukrainian forces have only
            recorded 22 radio frequencies in Kupyansk itself and that these
            radio signals are isolated to a small block of high-rise buildings
            in the center of Kupyansk.[45] Trehubov stated that Russian forces
            can only supply the surrounded units by drone drops.

            southern Drobysheve (northwest of Lyman) after what ISW assesses was
